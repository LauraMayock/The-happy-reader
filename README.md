Layout.

Github issues were used to create User Stories and any other Fixes or Updates for the project. This was where the project user was assigned, labels were added to show at a glance importance of tasks and help prioritise jobs. User story was added to the appropriate Iteration and the project. Each User Story, Fix or Update had a clear title, acceptance criteria and smaller tasks (if appropriate).

Milestones were used to create Iterations. There were 3 Iterations each dated appropriately. User Stories were completed based on the current Iteration that was in progress.
